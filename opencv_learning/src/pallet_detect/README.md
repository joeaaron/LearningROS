# YOLO + Python + ROS

#How to run
- do not have to download darknet, only use opencv

1. download package in your catkin_ws directory
2. catkin_make
3. publish your own image with the topic 'camear/image_color' or just you can modify the topic in yolo.py 
4. rosrun ${your package name} yolo.py
5. rosrun image_view image_view image:=MyDarknet/image_annotated


This code is to run YOLO with python + opencv3.3.1 on the ROS(Robotic Operating System)
If you publish your own image with the topic "camera/image_color,
   then this package would re-publish the image-annotated with the topic "MyDarknet/img_annotated"
